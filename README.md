# Logistic Regression for Advertisement Click Prediction

## Overview
This project uses Logistic Regression to predict whether a user will click on an online advertisement based on demographic and behavioural features.

## Objectives
- Perform data cleaning and exploratory analysis  
- Train and interpret a logistic regression model  
- Identify key features that influence ad clicks  
- Evaluate model accuracy and classification metrics  

## Dataset
Includes features such as:
- Age  
- Daily Time Spent on Site  
- Area Income  
- Internet Usage  
- Clicked on Ad (target)

## Workflow Summary
1. **Data Exploration**  
   - Visualisation of distributions and correlations  

2. **Preprocessing**  
   - Handling categorical variables  
   - Scaling numerical features  

3. **Model Training**  
   - Logistic Regression classifier  

4. **Evaluation**  
   - Confusion matrix  
   - Precision, Recall, F1-score  

## Results
- Age and internet usage proved strong predictors.
- Logistic regression achieved strong performance for a simple baseline model.

## Technologies Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Scikit-Learn
